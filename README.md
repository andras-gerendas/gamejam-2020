# Grim Repair

As the Grim Reaper, you spend your days delivering souls to the Afterlife.

Unfortunately the portal you use for this purpose has a tendency to break down and you're the only one around to repair it with your hammer.

To make things worse, there's a demon lurking in the shadows, waiting for its turn to capture souls and take them to the Underworld.

The demon has been imprisoned using a magical circle of runes, however powerful witches are hard at work trying to break these shackles, so you need to re-paint it to make sure the souls get to rest in peace.
